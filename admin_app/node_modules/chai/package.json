Want to know if your browser is compatible?\nRun the [online test suite](http://chaijs.com/support/tests/).\n\n## Plugins\n\nThe Chai community is growing! Plugins allow developers to expand Chai's available \nassertions. Here is what the community has come up with so far:\n\n* [chai-spies](https://github.com/logicalparadox/chai-spies) is a basic spy implementation for chai. It's also\na good resource for building chai plugins that work in both node.js and the browser.\n* [chai-jquery](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/chai-jquery) by [@jfirebaugh](https://github.com/jfirebaugh)\nprovides deep jQuery integration with chai's `should` and `expect`.\n* [jack](https://github.com/vesln/jack) by [@vesln](https://github.com/vesln) is a mock/stub library that \ncan be used as a stand-alone or with chai.\n* [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai) by [@domenic](https://github.com/domenic) extends chai with \nassertions for the Sinon.js mocking framework.\n* [chai-as-promised](https://github.com/domenic/chai-as-promised) by [@domenic](https://github.com/domenic) extends\nchai with assertions about promises.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you have questions or issues, please use this projects\n[Github Issues](https://github.com/logicalparadox/chai/issues). You can also keep up to date\non the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/chaijs) or ping [@jakeluer](http://twitter.com/jakeluer)\ndirectly on Twitter. Chai developers can also be found on Freenode IRC in #letstest.js. \n\n## Versions\n\nThe current stable version tree is the `0.5.x` tree on the `master` branch.
